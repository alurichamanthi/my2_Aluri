### Chamanthi Aluri

I have spent the last two years in the industry honing my talents and earning priceless industry experience. I am a tech enthusiast with a solid background in software engineering. I am committed to furthering my knowledge and expertise while I seek a master's degree because I am passionate about technology. I have an adventurous side that makes me want to visit new locations and cultures aside from coding and programming. I enjoy learning about the diversity and beauty of the world, whether I'm traveling to busy tech centres or hiking through the tranquil landscapes of national parks. This fusion of technical mastery with a lust for discovery determines my identity and motivates my pursuit of lifelong learning and development.
